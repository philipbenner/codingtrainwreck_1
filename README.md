From the Coding Challenge 1

This is from The Coding Trains 'Coding Challenge'. Daniel Shiffman runs this Youtube channel. 

I have been programming for 14 years professionally so most of these 'should' be easy...  I don't know p5.js nor do I know processing. So, instead of just watching his videos and knowing whats going to happen in my head. I know I need to actually do it and that is how I will learn p5.js.   I will eventually work on learning processing and making these examples over there.
